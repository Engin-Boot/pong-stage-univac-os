# Direction of ball

## Feature

motion the ball in different directions(2D) within dimension

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Determine direction

  Given the player is ready in game

  When the ball begin to move from one of the player
  
  Then the direction changes when ball touches the horizontal
  side based on angle of i= angle of r.
  
### Scenario:Collison with paddle

  Given the player is ready in game
  
  When the ball begin to move and touches the paddle
  
  Then ball moves in direction based of i=r and based on
  conservation of momentum,the velocity changes.

### Scenario:Collison behind the paddle

  Given the player is ready in game
  
  When the ball begin to move and does not touches
  the paddle or horizontal side
  
  Then score is updated(+1) based on the position of
